## Avoid Barrel File Imports

Import directly from source files instead of barrel files to avoid loading thousands of unused modules. **Barrel files** are entry points that re-export multiple modules (e.g., `index.js` that does `export * from './module'`).

Popular icon and component libraries can have **up to 10,000 re-exports** in their entry file. For many React packages, **it takes 200-800ms just to import them**, affecting both development speed and production cold starts.

**Why tree-shaking doesn't help:** When a library is marked as external (not bundled), the bundler can't optimize it. If you bundle it to enable tree-shaking, builds become substantially slower analyzing the entire module graph.

**Incorrect (imports entire library):**

```tsx
import { Check, X, Menu } from "lucide-react";
// Loads 1,583 modules, takes ~2.8s extra in dev
// Runtime cost: 200-800ms on every cold start

import { Button, TextField } from "@mui/material";
// Loads 2,225 modules, takes ~4.2s extra in dev
```

**Correct (prefer direct imports or framework-level import optimization):**

If your framework or bundler can optimize package imports automatically, use
that. Otherwise, import from smaller entry points directly.

**Correct (direct imports when needed):**

```tsx
import Button from "@mui/material/Button";
import TextField from "@mui/material/TextField";
// Loads only what you use
```

> **TypeScript warning:** Some libraries do not ship `.d.ts` files for their
> deep import paths. Verify the library exports types for its subpaths before
> relying on deep imports in strict projects.

These optimizations provide 15-70% faster dev boot, 28% faster builds, 40% faster cold starts, and significantly faster HMR.

Libraries commonly affected: `lucide-react`, `@mui/material`, `@mui/icons-material`, `@tabler/icons-react`, `react-icons`, `@headlessui/react`, `@radix-ui/react-*`, `lodash`, `ramda`, `date-fns`, `rxjs`, `react-use`.
